# Privacy Policy for Morgan Agenda de Tarefas

This privacy policy applies to the Morgan Agenda de Tarefas app (hereby referred to as the “Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Kevin Bezerra (hereby referred to as the “Service Provider”) as a free service. This service is intended for use “AS IS.”

This policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), where applicable.

### Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information in two ways: (1) data you provide, and (2) data collected automatically.

**Information You Provide**

As a task management application, the Service Provider processes only the data you voluntarily create and store within the Application, such as the text of your tasks and categories. This data is stored **locally on your device** and is not collected, transmitted, or accessible to the Service Provider.

*Note: If this Application adds cloud synchronization features in the future, this policy will be updated to reflect how and where that data is stored.*

**Automatically Collected Information**

The Application uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. This is done solely to provide analytics on how the app is used and to diagnose crashes.

This information may include, but is not limited to:

* **Approximate Location** (e.g., country and city, inferred from IP address)
* **Device Information** (e.g., model, operating system version)
* **Usage Data** (e.g., screens visited, session duration, interactions)
* **Diagnostic Information** (e.g., crash logs, stack traces, performance data)
* **Identifiers** (e.g., App Instance ID, Advertising ID, Crashlytics Installation UUID)
* **Internet Protocol address (IP address)**

The Application does not collect or use precise (GPS-based) location data.

### Third-Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data may be transmitted to external services to help improve the Application and its performance. The Service Provider may share information with third parties only in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.

The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own privacy policies regarding data handling. Below are links to the Privacy Policies of these service providers:

* [**Google Play Services**](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* [**Google Analytics for Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics)
* [**Firebase Crashlytics**](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

The Service Provider may disclose Automatically Collected Information:

* as required by law (e.g., to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process);
* when disclosure is necessary to protect rights, safety, or investigate fraud;
* to trusted service providers who work on behalf of the Service Provider, have no independent use of the data, and have agreed to follow this Privacy Policy.

### Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available on your mobile device or through the application marketplace.

### Data Retention Policy

**User-Provided Data** (such as your tasks and categories) is stored locally on your device and is managed entirely by you. This data remains on your device as long as you use the Application or until you choose to delete it. The Service Provider has no access to this data and cannot delete it for you. You can delete this data at any time by clearing the Application's data or by uninstalling the Application.

**Automatically Collected Data** (Analytics, Diagnostics) is retained by third-party services (Google) according to their own data retention policies.

### Children

The Application is not directed to anyone under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.

If the Service Provider becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided personal information, it will be deleted immediately.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact [wiseheaddp@gmail.com](mailto:wiseheaddp@gmail.com) so that the necessary actions can be taken.

### Security

The security of your personal data (your tasks) is managed by the security features of your own device's operating system, as this data is stored locally and does not leave your device.

For the automatically collected data (Analytics and Diagnostics), the Service Provider relies on the robust security measures of Google. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While the Service Provider and its partners strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

### Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.

The Service Provider will notify you of any changes by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy.

If the Application is updated via the app store, continued use of the updated version constitutes acceptance of the modified Privacy Policy.

You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.

**Effective date:** 2025-11-06

By using the Application, you consent to the collection and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, now and as amended in the future.
