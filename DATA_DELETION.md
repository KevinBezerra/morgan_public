# Data Deletion Request (Morgan Agenda de Tarefas)

This page describes how to request the deletion of your data collected by the "Morgan Agenda de Tarefas" application (the "Application"), developed by Kevin Bezerra (the "Service Provider").

### What Data Can Be Deleted?

1.  **Local Data (Your Tasks and Categories):**
    * This data is stored **only on your device**. The Service Provider **does not have access** to this data.
    * **How to delete:** You can delete this data at any time by clearing the Application's data in your Android settings or by simply uninstalling the Application.

2.  **Automatically Collected Data (Analytics/Crashlytics):**
    * The Application collects anonymous diagnostic and usage data (such as device type, approximate location, and crash reports) using Firebase services.
    * **How to delete:** You may request the deletion of this data associated with your device.

### How to Request Deletion of Automatically Collected Data

To request the deletion of the analytics and diagnostic data collected by Firebase, please send an email to:

[**wiseheaddp@gmail.com**](mailto:wiseheaddp@gmail.com)

The request will be processed, and associated analytics data will be removed from Firebase's servers according to Google's processes. Crash report data (Crashlytics) is already automatically deleted after 90 days.
